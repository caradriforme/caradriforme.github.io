    <h3> About this site </h3>

    <p>
    	I originally coded this website in a weekend so I'd have a link to put on job applications. However, as I've moved throughout my life,
	I've realized that there are projects I want to do and things I want to work on that I would really rather not associate with my "professional
	image", so to speak.
	<br><br>
	To prevent my weird personal projects from making me unhirable, I've turned this site into my career website. On here will be information
	that might be useful to recruiters, as well as a mild showcase of my technical abilities. If you'd like to get in touch - maybe you want 
	to see my resume, ask me a question, or just want to chat - feel free to email literally any address @ this domain; I have 
	routing set up so that they all go to me. 
	<br><br>
	And hey, if you want to see my personal site, reach out and I'll probably send you a link. I'd just rather not have it on this page for the
	scrapers to find :3
