	<h3> Compiled Thoughts </h3>

	This is a very brief blog - a compilation, really (haha) - about my thoughts on teaching a course on compilers.
	<br><br>
	This is not something I know that much about. But still! I'm used to my opinion being considered in every situation I encounter, and this should be no exception :3
	<br><br>
	My primary source for this blog is the Compilers course I took in my sophomore year of college, which was taught in OCaml. It spanned the entirety of the compilation pipeline, from lexing and parsing to emission of assembly code and library linking.

	<ol>
		<li> <a href="one.html">Assembly Structure: Designing the syllabus // Intermediate Passes: Introducing the structure</a> </li>
		<li> <a href="two.html">A-Normal Form: Lining up student projects // Context Expansion: Going the extra mile</a> </li>
		<li> <a href="three.html">Syntax Checking: Grading final projects // Lexing and Parsing: Taking feedback</a> </li>
	</ol>

	Yes, this list is in opposite order from how compilers work. I did that to be funny :p
